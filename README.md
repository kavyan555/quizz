### *Overview*
This platform generates quiz questions based on user-provided topics using Gemini-1.5-Flash. The application consists of a frontend built with Next.js, a backend using server actions, and PostgreSQL as the database, managed through Prisma.

Additionally, the platform tracks user success rates and provides a leaderboard. AI-driven recommendations, real-time analytics, and personalized learning tips enhance the user experience.
